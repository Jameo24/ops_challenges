What is this repo all about?

This is our final repository for 201 class and it was a definite challenge to learn.

Why are you learning these skills?

I am learning these skills to familiarize myself with machine learning and a skill to work on.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

I learned how a script can make things more automated and easier for you.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

My favorite ops challenge was the pipeline one. It just made sense and I did not have to google and youtube much to figure things out.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

They can be used to make some things automated for you to make your work  life a little easier.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

I would work more in bash and use loops since that really confused me and I am not really understanding that concept very well.

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I would like to improve on understanding what is going on and when I writ ethe script what is to be executed and not require so much help from the TA or Teacher.
